## 📌 About The Project

This is the **second design version** of the SHK Devs course project.
A fully redesigned take on the same fictional digital agency, featuring a more dynamic two-column hero layout, animated orbital rings around the logo, and Font Awesome icons throughout.

Built as part of an **HTML course assignment**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** SHK Devs is a fictional concept created purely for academic purposes. All clients, statistics, and services shown are illustrative only.
